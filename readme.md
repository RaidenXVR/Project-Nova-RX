# 🌸 Project Nova

## A Fully Local AI Companion with Memory, Emotion, Voice, Avatar Control, and Agentic Abilities

**Project Nova** is a fully local, real-time AI companion designed to feel persistent, emotionally aware, and interactive.  
It combines a fine-tuned large language model, long-term memory, expressive text-to-speech, speech recognition, and live 3D avatar control — all optimized to run on consumer hardware.

>### 🔔 Updates
>### v0.5 — Nova Web UI update (Latest)
> - A simple, clean web interface for **Nova** - your local AI companion.
> ### Features
> - Run web_ui.py if you want to use Web UI, otherwise run main.py if you want to use Nova via Terminal
> - **Text Chat**  - Type your messages
> - **Voice Input** - Toggle mic button , speak naturally
> - **Real Time Responses** - Nova replies with emotion and memory
> ### Usage
> - Type a message and press Enter
> - Click the Mic button to speak (press again to stop)
> - Nova responds - conversation continues
> ### Tech Stack
> - Gradio (Web UI)
> - Python (backend Logic) 
>### v0.4 — Nova Vision update (Latest)
> - Nova's vision capabilities have been upgraded from simple webcam support to full Environment Awareness. She can now also see your screen.
> - New **Look** Capabilities:
>   - **Contextual Screen Capture:** Nova doesn't waste resources by recording. Instead, she captures a snapshot only when you ask: "Nova, checkout my screen!" or "What's on my screen?.
>   - **Dual-Source Input:** Seamlessly switch between the Webcam (to see your face/emotions) and the Screen (to see your games, code, or art).
>   - **Hardware Optimized:** Designed to run alongside high-end games without causing FPS drops.
>
>### v0.3 — Nova V2
> - Nova's model has been completely re-trained from the ground up to be more stable, expressive, and structurally sound.
> - While V1 was successfully fine-tuned to repond in JSON format, it required a System Prompt to guide the model for that behavior. V2 has been deeply trained (455 steps, 0.39 loss) to make JSON and the personality its native language. It now understands the JSON structure at a foundational level, making it more **'alive,'** and **'emotionally expressive'**.
> - **Download** the new version from Huggingface - https://huggingface.co/Navpy/phi-3.5-AI-Vtuber-json
> - For **Ollama** users use the Modelfile which is inside **assistant_modelfile/** folder to get the best results out of the model **(RECOMMENDED)**.
>
>
>### v0.2 — Multimodal Capabilities (Project Nova Vision)
>- Project Nova is now a **Multimodal AI Agent**. Using a custom-engineered pipeline, Nova can "see" her environment and react in real-time while maintaining her 3D persona.
>
>
>### 🛠️ Technical Architecture
>- To fit a vision-language model (VLM) alongside a fine-tuned LLM on a limited **4GB RTX 2050**, I implemented a **Sequential Model Offloading** strategy:
>
> 1. **Intent Trigger:** A keyword-based heuristic (e.g., "Look at this") triggers the vision sequence.
> 2. **Resource Swapping:** To prevent OOM (Out of Memory) crashes, the system dynamically swaps models between System RAM and GPU VRAM.
> 3. **Visual Injection:** The resulting image description is injected into Nova's context as **Internal Sensory Data**, allowing her to react naturally without breaking character.
>
>#### Models Used
>- **Vision:** `SmolVLM-256M` (Quantized for edge-level performance).
>
>
>### v0.1 — Discord Integration
>- Added **Discord bot support** to chat with Nova remotely
>- Uses the same **LLM, memory, and personality** system
>- Secure token handling via **`.env`** (not committed)
>- Can run alongside the **local voice/avatar version**
- #### Scroll below to see the instructions for setting up Nova as a Discord Bot.

> ⚠️ **Development Disclaimer**
>
> Project Nova was **not created using “vibe coding” or fully AI-generated code**.
>
> The system architecture, core logic, threading model, memory design, agentic behavior, and debugging were **designed, implemented, and validated manually**.
> 
>Time Taken for development (approx 2 months)
>
> AI tools were used **only as a support resource** for:
> - Understanding unfamiliar concepts (eg. Threading, RAG)
> - Exploring alternative approaches (eg. Chunking, Streaming TTS)
> - Identifying potential issues
>
> When automated suggestions failed or were incorrect, **all debugging, fixes, and final decisions were performed manually**.
>
> This project reflects hands-on engineering, iterative testing, and deliberate system design — not prompt-to-project generation.


## ✨ Core Features

### 🧠 Long-Term Memory (RAG-Based)

- Persistent memory powered by **ChromaDB**
- Semantic embeddings enable **retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)**
- Supports:
  - Explicit memories (user asks Nova to remember)
  - Episodic / emotional memories
  - Contextual recall during conversation
- Latest memories are injected at startup to maintain continuity across sessions

> Memory is semantic, persistent, and local — no hard-coded state.

---

 ### 🤖 Language Model (LLM)

- Uses a **Phi-3.5 fine-tuned model**  (4B parameters, Q4_K_M quantization)
- Fine-tuned on a **custom conversational dataset using Google Collab**
- Optimized for
  - Structured JSON output
  - Consistent personality
  - Low-latency local inference
- Runs locally via [Ollama](https://ollama.com)
- Enforced **structured JSON output**:
- Model is available at [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/Navpy/phi-3.5-AI-Vtuber-json)

```json
{
  "response": "text",
  "emotion": "emotion_name"
}
```

- Low-latency
- VRAM-efficient
- Optimized for real-time interaction
---
### 🗣️ Speech-to-Text (STT)
- Powered by Faster-Whisper
- Fully local and offline transcription
- Real-time microphone input
- Optimized for low latency and accuracy
---
### 🔊 Text-to-Speech (TTS) Architecture
Nova’s TTS system is designed for low latency, emotional expressiveness, and smooth playback — even on limited VRAM.
### 🧩 TTS Model
- Soprano-TTS (80M param, lightweight, local)
- GPU-accelerated using CUDA
- Emotion-aware generation via controlled parameters:
    - temperature
    - top_p
    - repetition_penalty
### 🧠 Text Processing
Output text is cleaned to remove patterns that commonly cause hallucinations or unstable TTS output:
- Ellipses (..., ……)
- Stutters (I...I'll)
- Excess punctuation
- Newlines and malformed tokens
### ⚙️ Chunking + Streaming System (Producer–Consumer)
Nova does not generate and play audio in a blocking way. Instead, she uses a producer–consumer threading architecture.
1. **Chunking** : Response text is split into natural sentence chunks to prevent long generations and enable early playback.
2. **Producer Thread (Audio Generation)** : Generates audio chunks sequentially and pushes them into a shared queue.
3. **Consumer Thread (Audio Streaming)** : Continuously reads from the queue and streams to the output device. Playback begins before full generation completes.
#### ✅ Results: Low perceived latency, natural pauses, and stable audio.
---
### 🎭 Emotional Expression System
Each LLM response includes an emotion tag that controls:
- 🎙️ Voice generation parameters
- 🧍 Facial expressions
- 🕺 Idle animations
#### **Behavior** : Emotion is applied at speech start and automatically released when playback ends.
---
### 🧍 3D Avatar Control (VMC Protocol)
- Uses **VMC / VSeeFace** protocol
- Sends real-time data for:
    - Facial expressions
    - Head movement
    - Emotional states
- Avatar reacts synchronously with voice and emotion
---
### 🎧 Audio Routing & Lip-Sync
- Audio output routed through **Virtual Audio Cable**
- VSeeFace uses the virtual cable as microphone **input**
- Enables accurate **real-time lip-sync**
---
### 🕒 Time Awareness
- Natural language date & time awareness
- Conversations and memories are timestamped
- Nova can reference time contextually
---
### 🤖 Agentic Abilities
**Nova can perform real system actions based on user intent:**
- 🎵 Play songs on YouTube (via songs.json)
- 🌐 Open websites (Google, YouTube, etc.)
- 🗂️ Perform basic file operations
- 🧠 Decide when to act vs respond conversationally
> ⚠️ Some agentic actions (e.g., file operations) are intentionally limited and rule-based to prevent unintended behavior.
#### **All agentic logic is:** Fully local, rule-based, and explicitly triggered.

- **NVIDIA GPU:** (4–6 GB VRAM minimum)
## 🧪 Development & Minimum Hardware Target

Project Nova was **designed, developed, tested, and optimized** on the following hardware:

- **GPU:** NVIDIA RTX 2050  
- **VRAM:** 4 GB
